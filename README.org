    - [ ] floating number support
    - [ ] prefix support [0%]
      - [ ] 0b or 0 for binary
      - [ ] 0B for 1s complement (will convert to negative if left most after prefix is 1)
      - [ ] 0B2 for 2s complement (will convert to negative if left most after prefix is 1)
      - [ ] 0O for octal
      - [ ] none or 0d decimal
      - [ ] 0x for hex
      - [ ] decimal point is floating number
      - [ ] f + above prefix is floating number
    - [ ] arguments [0%]
      - [ ] h for help
      - [ ] v for version
      - [ ] o for output file
      - [ ] i for input source
      - [ ] b + B|B1|B2|O|D|H define base without prefix, even if there is prefix, this arg takes priority.
      - [ ] a take the input as all possible base regardless of prefix, and convert to all bases
      - [ ] d decimal point expression
      - [ ] /B/B1/B2/O/D/H for only specific conversion [0/6]
        - [ ] B convert to binary, if negative, convert to 2s
        - [ ] B1 convert to 1s complement
        - [ ] B2 convert to 2s complement
        - [ ] O convert to octal
        - [ ] D convert to decimal
        - [ ] H convert to hex
    - [ ] IO [0%]
      - [ ] read from file
      - [ ] out from file
    - [ ] support arithmetic operations
